- Installation
In order to play, you will need to install SMBX2 beta 5 first. You can find that -here-.
Go through that installation process, and afterwards you can install SMATRS.
Extract the ZIP file into data/worlds of SMBX2. 
Afterwards, open SMBX2 and you should get a view of the episode list. SMATRS should now be on that list.
Select it, and then simply click on Play. The game should now open!

Tips:
Resizing the game window is recommended, as it defaults to SMBX's original resolution.
On the episode list, there is a trophy icon at the bottom left. Clicking on it will show achievements you can unlock!
You can easily change controls within SMATRS, by going into settings.
